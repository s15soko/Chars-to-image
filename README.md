# Chars-to-image

#### 🔧 How it works? 

It takes the content from txt file where are randomly saved different letters/ words. 
<br/> Each letter has own color (as Hex Code - definied in Colors class). 
<br/> By this data it generates for example an image about size 512x512 - where each letter from txt file is one pixel in image.
